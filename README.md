## Force Glove

Grip Sense, Ltd.
Smart wearable for real-time strength balance detection during weightlifting.

## About

The Force Glove is a fitness technology designed to detect and correct muscle imbalances during strength training. By integrating Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs), Arduino, and wireless communication modules, the glove provides real-time feedback on bilateral force distribution to help prevent injuries and improve performance.

## Features

Real-time grip force feedback via LCD display

Wireless communication between gloves

Alerts when strength imbalance exceeds threshold

Lightweight and gym-ready design

Affordable (~$153.35 estimated cost)

## Built With

Arduino IDE (C/C++)

Next.js (for project website)

Laser-cut wooden housing

Conductive fabric gloves with embedded FSRs

## Quick Start

Wear gloves and connect arm sleeves.

Force sensors detect grip pressure in real-time.

Wireless modules transmit and compare data.

LCD displays show force readings; LEDs alert imbalance.

## Future Improvements

Fully enclosed, seamless glove design

App integration for detailed workout tracking

Enhanced wireless stability
